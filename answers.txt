Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: the program would slow down in proportion to the number of simulations

With a small number of simulations... the time will be innacurate

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 1000

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about... 1000
